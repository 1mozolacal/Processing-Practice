# typingTrainer

A program design to help practice typing. You can select the type of characters set you would like to improve on(number, uppercase, lower case, punctuation, etc). Data is collected on each character(the number of mistakes, speed, times typed) to target your weakest characters so you can improve faster.

Next steps are adding word set to practice on and improve the user interface.
